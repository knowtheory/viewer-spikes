    <h1>DocumentViewer Experiments</h1>
    <p>
      The DocumentViewer project is a major front end component of the DocumentCloud platform.  Originally authored by Alan McLean at the New York Times, the DocumentViewer was subsequently open sourced, and taken over by Jeremy Ashkenas at DocumentCloud.  Since DocumentCloud's migration to Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors, the project has been maintained by Ted Han.
