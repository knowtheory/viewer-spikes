# Planning

## Page Overlays (notes)
* Pages must provide a mechanism for overlays to hook into for loading/unloading.


## Note List Display

## Text Display

## Search

## Chrome
Open questions:

* What default set of interactions should be available?

## Ideas

* Indicate current page number w/ a tab that appears when scrolling, which is grabbable, and assignable.
* Indicate which pages have notes relative to page position in the scrollbar?
